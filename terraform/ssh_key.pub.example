# SSH Key for VMSS
# 
# Before deploying, generate an SSH key pair:
#   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f terraform/ssh_key -N ""
#
# This will create:
#   - terraform/ssh_key (private key - keep secure)
#   - terraform/ssh_key.pub (public key - used by Terraform)
#
# The public key will be used to access VMSS instances.
